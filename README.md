    <p>
      • Simulates the spread and extent of a disease (Covid-19) taking a virtual
      population count and their interactions and behavior into account.<br />
      • Shows result for any community spreadable disease given its infectivity
      rate. <br />• Displays the number of people infected and its
      standard deviations on the nth day of start of the pandemic in a location.

    <h2>Algorithm Used:</h2>
    <p>Modified Floyd Warshall for finding the Transitive Closure.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Number of Infected persons decreases with limiting interactions.</li>
        <li>Restricting service provider doesn’t mean much until we restrict normal residents 
            to an extreme extent
            </li>
            <li>Faced challenges while deciding the various setting of the town, normal residents’ 
                interactions, service providers’ interactions in accordance with the total 
                population.Solved it by sampling different inputs and testing from multiple cases and got the 
                most suitable settings
                </li>
